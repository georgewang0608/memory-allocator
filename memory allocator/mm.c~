/* Static functions for unscaled pointer arithmetic to keep other code cleaner.
   Casting to a char* has the effect that pointer arithmetic happens at
   the byte granularity (i.e. POINTER_ADD(0x1, 1) would be 0x2).  (By
   default, incrementing a pointer in C has the effect of incrementing
   it by the size of the type to which it points (e.g. block_info).)
   We cast the result to void* to force you to cast back to the
   appropriate type and ensure you don't accidentally use the resulting
   pointer as a char* implicitly. The first argument to these functions
   is of type void* to enable you to pass in any type of pointer into the function

/******** FREE LIST IMPLEMENTATION ***********************************/


/* A block_info contains information about a block, including the size
   and usage tags, as well as pointers to the next and previous blocks
   in the free list.  This is exactly the "explicit free list" structure
   illustrated in the lecture slides.

   Note that the next and prev pointers and the boundary tag are only
   needed when the block is free.  To achieve better utilization, mm_malloc
   should use the space for next and prev as part of the space it returns.

   bits of the size_and_tags field to tag a block as free/used, etc, like this:
